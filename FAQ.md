### Can i develope custom languages support files without using the build system ? ###

**A:** NO! Compared to EnlighterJS v2 it is not longer possible to add custom language files to your page by just including the javascript files. This is caused by the new systems architecture (monolithic library) of EnlighterJS v3 - everything (classes, namespaces, languages) is isolated from the page and not exposed as global variable.
